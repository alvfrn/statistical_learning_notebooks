    "Statistical learning refers to a set of tools used to analyse data in order to extract important patterns and trends that can help solve problems in both industry and science. \n",
    "This set of tools can be roughly categorized in **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the course we focus on supervised learning tools which aim to predict the **value** of an outcome measure based on a number of input measures. At the final chapter, the book introduces two unsupervised learning methods, in which the objective is not to predict the value of an outcome, but to describe the **associations** and **patterns** among a set of input measures.\n",
